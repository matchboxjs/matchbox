matchbox
========

Strike anywhere!

**NOTICE**

A big thanks for [sorribas](https://github.com/sorribas) for handing over the namespace for this project!
If you're looking for the transaction and invoce utiliy for emails, 
it is still available as the 1.0.2 release. Just `npm install matchbox@1.0.2` to get it.

From `2.0.0` this module contains the [matchbox](https://github.com/matchboxjs) project.

## Info

Matchbox is a modular framework for building web apps.
It's built from the ground up to be extensible, decoupled, and plug-and-play.

It includes:

 - a robust class factory as a base
 - a ui kit for views
 - a communication layer

You can also install all of the included packages as standalone modules.

### How it's different

Matchbox distingushes itself by providing solutions that work well together or isolated.
It's not designed to be a typical MVC implementation.

The architecture of the components is formed by everyday problems and years of experience; 
they cater to the needs of a day-to-day web app developer. 
It's not too opinionated so you won't feel your hands are tied, 
but also well defined so you'll always know how things work and how to use them.
No more getting lost in vendor code.

### Work in progress

The library is very much work in progress. As of this README, you won't find a single documentation on any of the repos.
There are tests for every one of them though, so if you're interested, start there!

Everything is "coming soon" now, but stay tuned/get involved; 
I wish to make this project something that hopefully a lot of us will enjoy using.

## Contribution

Feel free to send PRs to any of the matchbox repos here. 
This one's an umbrella repository that will grow and shape with time.

There's no style guide yet, and even the current source is inconsistent in some places, so be careful and use your best judgement until a style guide is in effect.
