Strike anywhere!

**NOTICE**

A big thanks for [sorribas](https://github.com/sorribas) for handing over the namespace for this project!
If you're looking for the transaction and invoce utiliy for emails, 
it is still available as the 1.0.2 release. Just `npm install matchbox@1.0.2` to get it.

From `2.0.0` this module contains the [matchbox](https://github.com/matchboxjs) project.

## Info

Matchbox is a modular front-end app framework.
It's built from the ground up to be extensible, decoupled, and plug-and-play.

The core contains a standardised directory structure (or namespaces).
Other modules build on top of this and provide solutions for views, models and everything else.

Some sub components include:

 - views
 - model layer
 - dom utilities
 - browser utilities

Sub modules can also be used standalone, since they don't depend on each other.

### How it's different

Matchbox distingushes itself by providing solutions that work well together or isolated.
It's not designed to be a typical MVC implementation.

This architecture born from everyday problems and years of experience.
On the lowest level it only provides a frame for organizing code and bootstrapping, 
but it's easily extensible by plugins.

### Work in progress

The library is very much work in progress. As of this README, you won't find a single documentation on any of the repos.
There are tests for every one of them though, so if you're interested, start there!

Everything is "coming soon" now, but stay tuned/get involved; 
I wish to make this project something that hopefully a lot of us will enjoy using.

## Contribution

Feel free to send PRs to any of the matchbox repos here. 
This one's an umbrella repository that will grow and shape with time.

There's no style guide yet, and even the current source is inconsistent in some places, so be careful and use your best judgement until a style guide is in effect.
